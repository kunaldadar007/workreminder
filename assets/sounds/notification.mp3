# This is a placeholder file for the notification sound
# In a real implementation, you would place an actual MP3 file here
# You can download free notification sounds from sites like:
# - https://www.zapsplat.com/
# - https://freesound.org/
# - https://www.soundjay.com/
#
# Recommended sound characteristics:
# - Duration: 1-3 seconds
# - Format: MP3 or WAV
# - Size: Under 100KB
# - Type: Gentle alert/chime sound
#
# For now, the system will work without sound, but you should add
# a real notification.mp3 file for the complete experience.
